# Command create

## What it does

This command when executed will start off the deployment process. You can optionally use other options are listed in the help menu.

Accepts arguments:

```
  -verbose        Enable verbose for terraform console
  -var            Terraform variable to be passed to the create/destroy command
  -var-file       Terraform variable file name in current directory. (By default using var.tfvars)
  -flavor         Cluster compute template to use eg: small, medium, large
```

The `create` command will check if all the tools are installed for the deployment to start. If not then it will run the [setup](setup.md) command. Next, it will check if the variables file var.tfvars is available in the install directory or provided via argument `-var-file`, if not then it will run the [variables](variables.md) command.

The compute template can also be changed in the var.tfvars file using the `-flavor` argument via command `# ./openshift-install-powervs create -flavor small`. The [flavors](flavor.md) refer to the templates from https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-upi-powervs/tree/master/compute-var.

The Terraform console log for each attempt will be stored in `logs/` directory with file name as `ocp4-upi-powervs_<timestamp>_apply_<attempt_number>.log`. These log files can be used for debugging purpose.

## Usage

When `setup` and/or `variables` commands are already completed.
