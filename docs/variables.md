# Command variables

## What it does

This command when executed will run interactive prompts for gathering inputs for installing OpenShift on PowerVS. The results will be stored in a file named `var.tfvars` in the current directory which will be used as an input to the Terraform automation.

The installation process needs `pull-secret.txt` in the current directory for downloading OpenShift images on the cluster. If not found, the variables command will prompt for pull-secret contents.

Similar to pull-secret.txt file the script will also lookup for `id_rsa` & `id_rsa.pub` files. If not found it will prompt to use the current login user's SSH key pair at `~/.ssh/`. If you reply a `no` then the script will create an SSH key pair for you in the current directory. The private key `id_rsa` can be used to login to the cluster.
